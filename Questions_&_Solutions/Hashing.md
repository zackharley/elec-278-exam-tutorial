# Hashing
Suppose you wanted to take the data in an INI file and build a table in memory to hold the variable names and their current values.  You will want to look up names of variables  in your table and determine the current value associated with that name.  For example, you would look up the string “Language” and the value returned would be “English”. Design and implement a hash table that would be useful for this problem.  You may assume that there are never more than 256 names.  You will have to decide on a hash function to convert variable names to indexes. ADDITION – Add code to your insert to determine how many collisions occurred as you entered data into your table.   Try a second hash function and see if you can reduce the collisions, using the same set of data. 
 (What I want to learn from this is how to implement a hash function with strings)




what is the difference between a double pointer **P and and pointer *P?
