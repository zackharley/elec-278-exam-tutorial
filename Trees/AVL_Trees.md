# AVL Trees

> ***Definition:*** 
> An **Adelson-Velsky Landis (AVL) Tree** is a tree data structure in which 
> * every node has **at most** two children
> * at each node in an AVL tree, the values in the left subtree must be **less than or equal** to the value at the current node. Similarly, the values in the right subtree must be **greater than or equal** to the value at the current node. 
> * the tree is **height balanced**, meaning that at each node, the height difference in its left and right subtree can be at most 1
