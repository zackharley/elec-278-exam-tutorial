# Binary Search Trees
> ***Definition:*** A **binary search tree (BST)** is a tree data structure in which every node has **at most** two children. At each node in a BST, the values in the left subtree must be **less than or equal** to the value at the current node. Similarly, the values in the right subtree must be **greater than or equal** to the value at the current node.
